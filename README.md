# Titanic Competition

This is my (*first ever*) submission for the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview).

There are two solutions included: a `VotingClassifier` made up of `LogisticRegression`, `SVC`, `RandomForest`, and `GradientBoosting`, as well as a Keras deep-learning approach.
